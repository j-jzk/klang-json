# A demo JSON parser
This is a demo JSON parser written using [klang](https://github.com/j-jzk/klang) and _klang-prales_.
You can inspect the parser definition [here](src/main/kotlin/cz/j_jzk/json/Main.kt), the whole thing is under a 100 lines long.

This just shows how productive can one be with _klang_.
I think I have written the parser in under 45 minutes when I had nothing to do in a lesson of OPS.
